 * occurrence.  Functionally equivalent to strchr(3) with two variants:
 *
 *   ch != 0  →  Returns pointer to first byte equal to ch, or NULL if not found.
 *   ch == 0  →  Returns pointer to the NUL terminator (scan-to-end shortcut).
 *
 * This variant is used during argument/config parsing in rage_app_init_6418
 * to locate '/' or '-' prefix characters in command-line tokens.
 *
 * The function is an alias of util_21F0 in the binary (the linker merged the
 * two identical bodies into a single address).

 * 
 * This is commonly used in capsule-vs-capsule or capsule-vs-plane tests
