# Models Directory

This directory contains texture files and 3D model data.

## Expected Files

Extract from your copy of Rockstar Presents Table Tennis:
- Texture dictionaries (`.txd` files)
- Model files
- Font textures
- UI elements

## Custom Textures

Like re3, you can place custom texture files here to enhance the game:
- HD texture packs
- Custom fonts
- Modified UI elements
- Controller button prompts

## Format

Textures use Rockstar's TXD format (Texture Dictionary), which can be edited with tools like Magic.TXD or SparkIV.
